## so who am i?

i am a recent Computer Science graduate from the university of nottingham.
apparently, i enjoy going the difficult route -- e.g. why did i go though
this whole pain in using jekyll to statically serve this site?

more (or maybe less) intrestingly, i actually *like* the cli, having
lost a part of myself trying to install arch linux back in the midst of
completing my a-levels.

at least i got to learn vim pretty well -- so much so that neovim became
my go-to editor. definitely not going back now.

## ps

check out my [dotfiles](https://github.com/sebmentation-fault/dotfiles)
and let me know if you have any pointers for where they can be improved :)
