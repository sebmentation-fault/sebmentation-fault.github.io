Hi, I'm Sebastian! Welcome to my site!

If you can't tell, I'm interested in tech -- my dotfiles prove that I like to
use CLI tools, customize my development environment with Neovim and start learning
new programming languages before I've begun to master anything.

## What you will find here

On my site, you can find:

* An [about page]({% link about.md %}), if you want to find out a bit about myself
* (TODO) A portfolio page
* A blog where I will start to document experiences/configurations/my solutions

## TODO

Add more to the homepage -- it feels to empty in here!
